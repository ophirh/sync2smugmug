sync2smugmug
============

This program assumes a directory structure built of folders (just directories) and albums (directories with images). It will
scan the disk for all images file and upload those into SmugMug with the appropriate hierarchy. Synchronization can be both ways (either to the cloud or restore from the cloud).

Additional capabilities include different optimizations and cleanup algorithms, import photos from iPhone and more.
